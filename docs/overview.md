# KiCad Library Validator Overview

The KiCad Library Validator is a Python tool designed to ensure the integrity, consistency, and correctness of KiCad component libraries. It validates symbols, footprints, 3D models, and documentation against a user-defined YAML structure file.

## Key Features
- **Structure-based validation:** Enforce naming conventions, required properties, and directory layouts via a YAML structure file.
- **Comprehensive checks:** Validate symbols, footprints, 3D models, and documentation for completeness and correctness.
- **Customizable rules:** Adapt validation to your organization's standards by editing the structure file.
- **Reporting:** Generate detailed validation and test reports for CI/CD or manual review.

## Typical Workflow
1. **Define your library structure:** Create a YAML file describing your naming conventions, required properties, and directory layout.
2. **Run the validator:** Use the CLI or Python API to validate your library against the structure file.
3. **Review reports:** Examine the output for errors, warnings, and suggestions.
4. **Iterate:** Update your library or structure file as needed to resolve issues.
