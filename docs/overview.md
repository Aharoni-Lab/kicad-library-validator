# KiCad Library Validator Overview

The KiCad Library Validator is a Python tool designed to ensure the integrity, consistency, and correctness of KiCad component libraries. It validates symbols, footprints, 3D models, and documentation against a user-defined YAML structure file.

## Key Features
- **Deeply Nested Structure:** Support for complex component organization with multiple levels of subgroups and entries
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Enforce naming conventions, required properties, and directory layouts via a YAML structure file
- **Component-Specific Rules:** Validate pins, layers, pads, and other component-specific requirements
- **Flexible Organization:** Organize components by manufacturer, series, type, or any other hierarchy that fits your needs
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generate comprehensive validation and test reports for CI/CD or manual review

## Typical Workflow
1. **Define your library structure:** Create a YAML file describing your component organization, naming conventions, and validation rules
2. **Run the validator:** Use the CLI or Python API to validate your library against the structure file
3. **Review reports:** Examine the output for errors, warnings, and suggestions
4. **Iterate:** Update your library or structure file as needed to resolve issues

## Structure Organization
- **Symbols:** Organize by component type, manufacturer, series, etc.
- **Footprints:** Group by package type, manufacturer, series, etc.
- **3D Models:** Match component organization for easy reference
- **Documentation:** Organize by component category and documentation type
