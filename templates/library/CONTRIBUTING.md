# Contributing to [Lab Name] KiCad Library

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this library as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the library
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new components
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the library, if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of any new components or changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other maintainer
